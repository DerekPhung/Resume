        <b>TAP internship</b>
        <p>The Technology Ambassador Program is a service-learn internship dedicated to helping middle schoolers, high schoolers, and non-IT majors develop an interest in Information Technology.
         As a Technology Ambassador, I worked with a small team to build a workshop and game that the targeted demographics could explore the limitless world of IT. It was also our job to record 
         their responses using surveys to research how successful we were and present our findings to superiors and in I.T. conferences around the U.S. to further expand our workshop and research
          to other schools.</p>
